description: How to add custom badges to players on your GDPS using a Geode mod

This guide will show you how to add custom badges to your players in-game using the [GDPS Badges mod](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/m336.gdps-badges)!

*This guide is mostly intended for GDPS owners/administrators; if you are just a regular player, you should wait for your GDPS to announce compatibility with this mod to see custom badges added in-game.*

## Requirements
To be able to follow the rest of this guide, you will need to make sure that:
- You have full access to your GDPS' SFTP
- You have designed some custom badges that you want to add (After all, that’s the point of this guide.. isn’t it? *The recommended resolution is 92x92, the mod only accepts the PNG format*)

## Creating badges.json
In SFTP, go to the public root of your GDPS (usually `public_html`) and create a new folder called `badges`; this is where you will define properties for your badges and add their textures.

Inside the `badges` folder, create a `badges.json` file and fill it according to this example:
```json
[
    {
        "id": "owner",
        "name": "Owner",
        "description": "This is the <cr>owner</c> of this GDPS!",
        "requirements": {
            "players": [ 72 ]
        }
    },
    {
        "id": "demon-grinder",
        "name": "Demon Grinder",
        "description": "This player has beaten over <cr>2,500</c> demon levels!",
        "requirements": {
            "minDemons": 2500,
            "maxDemons": 9999
        }
    }
]
```

### Possible requirements
| Property | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `players` | A whitelist of account IDs that can have the badge | `"players": [ 72, 73, 74 ]` |
| `modBadge` | Add the custom badge if one of the mod badges is present. Can be either `leaderboard`, `elder` or `regular` | `"modBadge": "elder"` |
| `minRank` | Minimum global rank required to have the badge | `"minRank": 1` |
| `maxRank` | Maximum global rank allowed to have the badge | `"maxRank": 100` |
| `minStars` | Minimum number of stars required to have the badge | `"minStars": 1000` |
| `maxStars` | Maximum number of stars allowed to have the badge | `"maxStars": 5000` |
| `minMoons` | Minimum number of moons required to have the badge | `"minMoons": 500` |
| `maxMoons` | Maximum number of moons allowed to have the badge | `"maxMoons": 2000` |
| `minGoldCoins` | Minimum number of secret coins required to have the badge | `"minGoldCoins": 50` |
| `maxGoldCoins` | Maximum number of secret coins to have the badge | `"maxGoldCoins": 164` |
| `minSilverCoins` | Minimum number of user coins required to have the badge | `"minSilverCoins": 100` |
| `maxSilverCoins` | Maximum number of user coins allowed to have the badge | `"maxSilverCoins": 500` |
| `minDemons` | Minimum amount of demons beaten required to have the badge | `"minDemons": 10` |
| `maxDemons` | Maximum amount of demons beaten allowed to have the badge | `"maxDemons": 100` |

## Adding the badge icons
Now, just drag and drop the textures you have into the `badges` folder.
Make sure that it has the same name as the ID you put for the respective badge in `badges.json`!

For example, if you want to add the texture for the Demon Grinder badge above, you'd drag and drop a file named `demon-grinder.png`.

## Sharing the mod
Now, just inform your players that your GDPS is compatible with the mod:
- Either by [downloading it manually](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/m336.gdps-badges) and putting it in the Geode mods folder,
- Or, in-game, downloading it **from the index** as shown below:
